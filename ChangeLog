	* mono-webbrowser is a support module containing browser
	  backends for Mono.WebBrowser. It currently includes a WebKit backend and
	  will in the future also include the existing Gecko backend (the
	  Mono.Mozilla namespace that currently resides on Mono.WebBrowser). This
	  code can't be in Mono.WebBrowser directly because the webkit backend
	  uses webkit-sharp and gtk, and 1) those libraries are not yet available
	  when Mono.WebBrowser is getting built and 2) this avoids adding hard
	  dependencies on winforms.
